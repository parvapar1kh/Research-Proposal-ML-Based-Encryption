# ML-Based Encryption: Research Proposal and Literature Review

This project investigates how machine learning (ML) can enhance encryption algorithms to improve cryptographic performance and security, especially for sensitive data stored or transmitted in high-risk environments. It explores how ML can address current limitations in static encryption systems by introducing adaptability, intelligent key generation, performance scaling, and real-time threat detection.

## Objective

The goal of this research is to examine whether and how machine learning can transition encryption from a static, rule-based process into a dynamic, context-aware defense system. With growing threats from quantum computing, IoT-based vulnerabilities, and real-time attacks, this project asks: *Can ML reshape encryption in a way that responds, adapts, and evolves with modern cybersecurity challenges?*

## Research Summary

### 1. Encryption Key Generation with ML

ML enables smarter, more secure key generation by increasing randomness and making keys responsive to changing environments. Studies reviewed in this section show that ML-generated keys have:
- Higher entropy (Sayed, 2024)
- Greater resistance to brute-force attacks
- The ability to learn from system behavior and adjust accordingly (Okdem & Okdem, 2023; Chaudhary et al., 2022)

### 2. Performance Optimization and Scalability

For encryption to scale across massive datasets (finance, healthcare, IoT), ML can prioritize and adapt:
- Kour et al. (2024) show ML can rank data sensitivity and assign encryption strength accordingly
- Chinbat et al. (2024) apply this to constrained devices like wearables
- Asmar, Muath, and Tuqan (2024) show time-aware models adjusting encryption load in real-time

### 3. Real-Time Threat Detection

ML integration allows encryption to become proactive:
- Detects and blocks anomalies during transmission (Chaudhary et al., 2022)
- Identifies unauthorized access attempts before decryption begins (Okdem & Okdem, 2023)
- Learns from past attacks to adjust future defenses (Sayed, 2024; Asmar et al., 2024)

Together, these findings suggest a shift in encryption’s role — from passive data protection to active, adaptive threat response.

## Key Takeaways

- ML enhances encryption by improving entropy, detection, and adaptability
- Real-time intelligence turns encryption into a more responsive defense tool
- Scalability is achieved through smart resource allocation, not brute force
- The combination of performance, security, and adaptability points toward a future of self-adjusting cryptographic systems
